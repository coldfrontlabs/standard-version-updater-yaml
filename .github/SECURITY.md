## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability within this project, please [open an issue](https://github.com/coldfrontlabs/standard-version-updater-yaml/issues/new) and label it with the `security` tag. The issue board is checked at least 2-3 times a week, so you should expect a response to your issue within a few days.

If a PR is submitted along with the issue to resolve the vulnerability, you can expect it to be reviewed within the same time frame as issue responses. If a PR is not submitted, the time it takes to develop a fix will differ depending on the severity of the vulnerability.

## Vulnerabilities in dependencies

Vulnerabilities to dependencies ([yaml](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yaml)) will be updated as soon as a fix is available and an update will be pushed out.

Any vulnerable _dev_ dependencies will be updated when/if possible- though a new release of standard-version-updater-yaml may not be pushed out right away.
